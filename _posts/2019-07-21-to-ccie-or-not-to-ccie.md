Making commitments is hard. No, wait... scratch that. _Keeping_ commitments is hard. I'm a perennial starter of things. Finishing things or following through with them, that's the part I struggle with.

Blogging, for example. I've lost count of the number of blogs I've started. There's been many. Starting back when blogs were unheard of, to when they became cool, past when they went mainstream, till wherever we're at now. The desire to write always returns, so I blog. Inevitably, it fades, and I stop.

This time though, I'm considering linking this blog, at least initially, to my possible pursuit of the [CCIE](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert.html) (Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert) certification; as if tying it to an even bigger commitment will somehow lend both efforts more permanence.

Now I say _possible_ pursuit, because I realise just how much time and effort that particular commitment would entail. The CCIE, which boasted an incredible exam failure rate of [74%](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2308793/doctor--lawyer--non-techies-don-t-appreciate-cisco-networking-exam.html) back in 2006, is generally recognised as one of the hardest (and most prestigious) networking certifications in the industry. Many months of self-study and practical learning would be required to absorb the sheer breadth of networking knowledge covered by the certification, let alone to develop the speed of thought and action necessary for completing the multitude of implementation and troubleshooting tasks within the limited exam timeframes.

Combine that with my propensity for flagging motivation when the going gets tough, and you have a recipe for yet another promising start turned unfulfilled dream. One can only rack up so many of these before you become a little more circumspect about committing to overly ambitious projects. In this case, I've decided to give myself a three-month trial period before making a definitive call one way or the other about pursuing the certification. 

During those three months, I will try to study as much as possible. Initially, maybe only ~10-15 hours a week. But by the end of three months, I hope to have ramped that up to ~20-25 hours a week, if not more. I feel like this would be the minimum required work-rate (most likely for several months to a year) before I would even consider attempting the vaunted CCIE Lab exam. If I'm unable to develop that level of discipline within three months, then I probably don't want it enough and would just be setting myself up for failure. Conversely, if I _have_ built my study routine to that level by then, I'm probably in with a shot, and will make a full commitment to the cause.

Let the trial begin!
