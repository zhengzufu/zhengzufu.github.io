As usual, after writing a blog post about a potential new pursuit, some other thing immediately appears and grabs all of my attention and time. _"Squirrel!"_

This week, it has been the cybersecurity competition known as the Splunk [Boss of the SOC](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2019/06/27/australia-new-zealand-boss-of-the-soc-day-2019.html) (BOTSv3). To the uninitiated, [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) is essentially a software product (or platform), commonly used in Security Operations Centres (SOCs), that allows for the searching, monitoring, and analysing of machine-generated log data, and the BOTS competition sets out several cybersecurity-related scenarios with a bunch of questions that require you to use the platform to hunt down the answers.

Despite only being a one-day event, some friends and I extended the fun a little by setting up a server with last year's competition data ([BOTSv2](https://github.com/splunk/botsv2)) and refreshing (or in my case, learning for the _first_ time) some Splunk knowledge and skills. Given I don't use the software in my current job (yet), I'm actually glad we made the time to do some preparation, or I'd have been completely lost on the day. Instead, as it happened, I was only partially lost!

Can't complain though. I was actually very fortunate to even be there. Though we had a sizeable contingent from our cybersecurity department at the event, I was the only network team member invited along. Clearly, bothering them about every CTF under the sun has started to pay dividends. All-in-all, it was a day full of hair-pulling, stress-inducing, frustration and fun. And, thankfully, our teams did reasonably well too, all managing to scrape into the top 10 for the State. (Nationwide, it was a different story, but let's not worry about that minor detail.)

Now, if only other vendors (nudge-nudge, Cisco!) would follow Splunk's lead and set up their own CTF-style events, we could be having a lot more fun learning during work hours...
