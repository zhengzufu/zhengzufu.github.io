Last weekend (or actually, the weekend before last, thanks to my innate ability to procrastinate rather than finishing blog posts) saw the arrival of the much anticipated [BSides Perth 2019](https://bsidesperth.com.au/) information security conference. As expected, it was a veritable smorgasbord of security presentations, pizza, lock-picking, hackers and hacking. Oh, and caffeine. Lots of caffeine. Pretty much everything a budding cybersecurity enthusiast could want.

For me though, it was all about the CTF. I really can't get enough of these things. I'm not sure why I find it quite so satisfying to bash my head against a metaphorical wall, for hours on end, trying to derive a solution to something that, for worryingly extended periods of time (thanks in no small part to a complete absence of security skills), seems utterly unsolvable. It might have something to do with that rush of endorphins that accompanies those eventual "lightbulb" moments that lead to resolution. That feeling of ultimate, unadulterated, victory (or, is it simply relief...) just keeps me coming back for more. Over and over.

"Hi. My name's zhengzufu. And I'm an addict."

In all seriousness, I do love it. So, despite not eating any pizza, nor picking any locks, barely meeting any new hackers, and attending only the first and last talks of the conference (and only then because they didn't overlap with the CTF), I had an absolute blast. Full disclosure: it probably helped that my team came 3rd in the CTF, winning a funky medallion and a [Hak5 Signal Owl](https://shop.hak5.org/collections/physical-access/products/signal-owl).

Looking back, I probably should have taken the opportunity to check out a couple more of the talks. The two I did attend, *"Hacking the Grid"* and *"Internal Red Teams - Practicing what you preach"*, were both very good. Hopefully they'll all get published online soon. 

Finally, kudos to all the organisers, presenters, and the CTF challenge writers. I'm already looking forward to next year!
