It's been over 3 months since my last post. That's terrible, even by my standards. This time though, I feel like I have a better excuse.

Outside of work (more or less, haha), I've been spending almost every waking hour at [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu/). For the uninitiated, it's essentially a penetration-testing lab comprising a range of vulnerable machines against which one can test their proverbial hacking skills. The system has been completely gamified (points, ranks, high-score tables), given a slick interface, and new machines (each exploitable in different ways) are released on a regular basis.

The site has given me a whole new appreciation of what it takes to become a "hacker". The level of out-of-the-box (pun intended) thinking required, the sheer range of technologies, protocols, and exploitable weaknesses that must be understood, and the consequent value and necessity of learning *just enough* to get by. This last part, in particular, has never been my strong suit. I'm a chronic over-preparer (due in no small part to my ever-present fear of failure, or even just making mistakes). In general (read: always), I prefer to spend *days* researching the fundamentals of a technology before ever once raising a finger to try it out (if I even get there). When hacking machines, this approach is just not practical. It would take weeks, if not months or more, to ground myself properly in all the systems and software that form the possible attack surface of a single box, let alone many boxes.

In addition, I'm beginning to internalise the fact that there's a certain permanence and profoundness to the learning that occurs when actualising the knowledge one has gained. The reinforcement of theoretical concepts through a constant cycle of mistakes, feedback, and iterative improvements, is something that just can't be matched by mere book learning. This certainly isn't a new concept, by any stretch of the imagination, and I'm sure many people find this a very natural way to learn. For me, though, it's been quite the breakthrough.

There's plenty more I could say about [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu/), and maybe I'll go into greater depth in a future blog post, but for now, I'll just leave you with a particularly poignant excerpt from one of my all-time favourite books:

> Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month - the boy who had made his own jack-knife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this, - or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the meanwhile, and had received a Rogers' penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers?
> - *Walden*, by Henry David Thoreau
